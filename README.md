# Splash test task

# About me

I'm full stack (JS) dev with 20 years of experience on freelance market.

My main stack (90-95% of projects) is on (plain) Node/Vue3

I used React for 2-3 months overall

I used Sockets for last 10 years over REST/http API

I never used Nest before, only time when I dealt with RXJS is when I was working on Angular.

# Summary

I think I managed to complete around 50% of the task - UI, and frontend/backend integration via sockets.

I think it would take me 20-30 hours to complete so it would look and work exactly like in the video.

## Frontend

Is Nuxt frontend on port 3000

### Charts

Since I only worked with ChartJS recently, I used this

https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/samples/animations/progressive-line.html

But I think I should've used plain canvas though and draw plain points on x:time y:score instead.

If I have/had more time I'd do custom canvas no problem

## Backend

Is Nest in /backend dir on port 3010

# Current State

* UI is done in a rush
* Frontend connects to backend (events)
